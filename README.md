# ECSE3038_lab1
This is the first lab issued in ECSE3038 on January 29, 2021

## How the VersionControl.java class works
It has 3 private methods:
1. **hello();**
- Parameter type :- void 
- Return type :- void
 
2. **validatePassword();**
- Parameter type :- String
- Return type :- boolean

3. **sumUpToN();** 
- Parameter type :- int
- Return type :- int

There is also a main() method that outputs to the console in eclipse.
Prior to running the class, the user should code the parameters. 
The terminal will print the results as per function requirement in lab outline.

## Why was this code written
This code was written for the purpose of a laboratory exercise which aims to give students experience with version control using github.

## A short joke 
Did you hear about the Mathematician who is afraid of negative numbers?
>>He'll stop at *nothing* to avoid them.
